Scrape players even-strength TOI from any NHL game

### About

This is a program that uses Python and bs4 to scrape NHL players even-strength time on ice (TOI) for any NHL game. The program scrapes the NHL's official shift reports that are generated for every game and saves the output into a CSV file. I use these personally for my Expected Goals Model, when I want to know how much EV TOI a player had in a certain game.
